4. Ensures reliability and quality; software engineering practices such ads testing, debuggging and version control ensure that applications function correctly and meet user needs.
5. Enabling connectivity; from social media to cloud computing, software engineers build systems that allow people and devices to connect and share information globally.
6. Supporting scalability and growth; companies need scalable software solutions to handle increasing users and data.Software engineering ensures that applications remain efficient as they grow.
7. Improving efficiency and automation; businesses and industries rely on software to automate tasks, streamline operations and reduce human errors, saving time and resources.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The birth of software engineering( 1968 -NATO Conference) ;software engineering was first introduced at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference in response to Software crisis. Early software projects faced cost overruns, delays and poor quality due to a lack of structured development methods. The conference emphasized the need for systematic software development approaches similar to traditional engineering disciplines.
   IMPACT; It marked the beginning of structured software development practices and led to the adoption of formal methodologies like the Waterfall model for software development.
   2.The rise of Agile methodologies(2001-Agile manifesto); in  2001, 1 software developers met in Snowbird, Utah and created Agile manifesto. It emphasized flexibility, customer collaboration and interactive development over rigid document-heavy processes.
   IMPACT; Introduction of modern software development frameworks like Scrum,Kandan and Extreme Programming(XP).Shifted focus from long development cycles to continuous delivery and rapid iteration. Became the industry standard for software development, especially in startups and tech companies.
   3.The DevOps Revolution(2010s -Continuous Integration & Deployment) ;In the 2010s the rise of DevOps(Development + Operations) transformed how sofware was built, tested and deployed. Continuous Integration(CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) practices automated the software development pipeline.Tools like Docker,Kubernetes,Jenkins, and GitHub Actions streamlined development workflows.
   IMPACT; Improved collaboration between developers and IT operations, reducing software release times.Increased the adoption of Cloud Computing and Infrastructure as Code(IaC). Enabled the rise of Microservices Architecture, replacing monolithic software structures.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning; define project goals, feasibility, cost estimation and resource allocation. Example; identifying business needs and setting project timelines.
2. Reqirements analysis; gather and document software requirements from stakeholders. Example; creating software requirement specification(SRS) documents.
3. Design;create system architecture, UI/UX design and database structure.Example ;designing wireframes for web application.
4. Development/implementation;writing the actual code based on design specifications. Example; Deveopers coding in Python,Java or JavaScript
5. Testing; identifying and fixing bugs through unit, intergration, system and acceptance testing. Example;QA teams performing automated and manual testing
6. Deployment; releasing the software to users.Example; Deploying a mobile app on Google Play Store
7. Maintenance and Support; updating, fixing bugs and improving performance over time. Example;releasing security patches for a banking app.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

1. Approach; in waterfall , sequential (linear) approach is used while in agile methodology iterative & incremental approach is used.
2. Flexibility; waterfall methodology is rigid and structured while agile methodology is highly flexible and adaptive.
3. Requirements changes; in waterfall methodology it is difficult to change once the process starts while in agile methodology it can accomodate changes at any stage
4. Testing phase; in waterfall methodology testing is performed after development while in agile methodology there is continuous testing throghout the cycle.
5. Deivery; in waterfall methodology it is delivered as a single final product while in agile methodology it is delivered in multiple small releases(sprints)
6. Documentation; in waterfall methodology extensive documentation is required while in agile methodoogy it focuses on working software over documentation.
7. customer involvement; in waterfall methodology minimal after requirements are set while in agile methodology there is continuous feedback from stakeholders.
   WHERE TO USE EACH METHODOLOGY;
   1. Waterfall methodology; suitable for projects with fixed requirements for example banking software, government systems. Example;Airline ticket reservation system that needs strict documentation and regulatory compliance
   2. Agile methodology;best for dynamic projects where requirements change frequently ( e.g, startups,mobile apps). Example;E-commerce website that needs rapid updates based on user feedback.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. SOFTWARE DEVELOPER; -Writes tests and maintains code based projects requirements, colaborates with designers QA teams and DevOps engineers.Example task;developing a login authentication system.
2. QUALITY ASSURANCE(QA) ENGINEER; Ensures the software is bug-free and meets quality standards,performs manual and automated testing . Example task;Running test cases to check if a new feature works correctly.
3. PROJECT MANAGER(PM);Plans organizes and oversees software development, ensures deadlines budgets and stakeholder expectations are met. Example Task; managing sprint planning in an Agile environment.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. Intergrated Development Environments(IDEs); provide tools for writing debugging and running code, improve efficiency by offering features like syntax highlighting autocompletion and debugging tools. Examples; Visual Studio code(lightweight, multi language support),IntelliJ IDEA(Best for Java development), PyCharm(Python deveopment)
2. Version control systems(VCS); help track code changes collaborate with teams and prevent data loss, support branching merging and rollback features. Examples; Git (most widely used works locally and with remote repositories),GitHub(cloud-based Git repository hosting),Bitbucket(good for private repositories and enterprise use)

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Tight deadlines can be solved by using Agile methodology to break tasks into smaller iterations.
2. Changing requirements can be solved by implementing flexible development approaches like Scrum
3. Debugging & bug fixing can be solved by using automated testing, logging and debugging tools
4. Team collaboration issues can be solved by use of tools like Jira, Trello and Slack for better communication.
5. Security risks can be solved by implementing secure coding practices, encryption and security testing.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing; tests individual components of the software.
2. integration testing; tests how different modules interact with each other.
3. System testing; tests the entire software system as a whole
4. Acceptance testing; ensures the software meets business requirements before release
